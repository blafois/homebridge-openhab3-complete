# Homebridge Plugin for OpenHAB3 - Complete Edition

This project is entirely based on SteilerDev project for OpenHAB2.

> Exceeding features of [homebridge-openhab2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-openhab2) and [openHAB's Homekit Plugin](https://www.openhab.org/addons/integrations/homekit/) since `v.0.3.0`

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/homebridge-openhab2-complete.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/homebridge-openhab2-complete/)

This [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin for [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org) fully supports all services offered by Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP), as far as it is feasible based on the item types offered by OpenHAB (see [below](#supported-hap-services) for the currently supported 32 accessories). In opposite to the existing [openHAB homebridge plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-openhab2) or the native [openHAB Homekit Plugin](https://www.openhab.org/addons/integrations/homekit/), this plugin requires explicit declaration of accessories in the homebridge configuration and does not use openHAB's tagging system, which leads to a little more effort during configuration, but proves more reliable and functional in more complex installations. See [Comparisson](#comparison) below.

## Installation
*Note: Please install [homebridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge) first.*

```
npm install -g homebridge-openhab2-complete
```

Some people are experiencing dependency issues between homebridge's node version and the required node version for this project. My local setup is based on [oznu's homebridge docker container](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge), where I never ran into any problems. In order to install the plugin in the docker, just add `npm install homebridge-openhab2-complete` to the `startup.sh` script inside the mapped docker volume.

## Configuration
This is a platform plugin, that will register all accessories within the Bridge provided by homebridge. The following shows the general homebridge configuration (`config.json`), see the [Supported HAP Services below](#supported-hap-services), in order to get the detailed configuration for each service.

```
{
    "bridge": {
        ...
    },

    "accessories": [
        ...
    ],

    "platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "openHAB2-Complete",
            "host": "http://192.168.0.100",
            "port": "8080",
            "accessories": [
                {
                    "name": "An items name, as shown in Homekit later",
                    "type": "switch",
                    "item": "Itemname-within-OpenHAB"
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
* `platform` has to be `"openHAB2-Complete"`
* `host`: The IP or hostname of your openHAB instance. The Protocol specifier (`http://`) is optional, defaults to `http://` (independent of the specified port)
* `port`: *(optional)* If not specified the default port of the specified `host` protocol is used.
* `accessory`: An array of accessories exposed to HomeKit, see the next chapter for available services and their configurations.

Alternatively you can group accessories of the same `type` in a sub-array:
```
...
    "platforms": [
        {
            ...
            "accessories": [
                {
                    "type": "switch",
                    "items": [
                        {
                            "name": "An items name, as shown in Homekit later",
                            "item": "Itemname-within-OpenHAB"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "An items name, as shown in Homekit later",
                            "item": "Itemname-within-OpenHAB"
                        },
                        ...
                    ]
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
...
```

## Configuration for every accessory
### Grouping
Since iOS 13 multiple accessories can be grouped within a single accessory. This can be -as far as I have tested- done in an arbitrary way. The syntax to define a grouped item is as follows:
```
{
    {
        "type": "group",
        "name": "Group Name",
        "model": "Group Type Model",
        "batteryItem": "Itemname-within-OpenHAB",
        "batteryItemThreshold": "20",
        "items": [
            {
                "type": "homebridge-openhab2-complete item type",
                "name": "An items name, as shown in Homekit later",
                "item": "Itemname-within-OpenHAB"
            }, {
                "type": "homebridge-openhab2-complete item type",
                "items": [
                    {
                        "name": "An items name, as shown in Homekit later",
                        "item": "Itemname-within-OpenHAB",
                    }, {
                        ...
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
```
* `type`: Needs to be `"group"`
* `name`: The name as shown in HomeKit later (in some instances I have experienced that this name is dropped in favor of the first item's name)
* `model` *(optional)*: A model description, defining the grouping. This is only shown in the expanded settings of the group.
* `batteryItem`, `batteryItemThreshold`, ... *(optional)*: A battery service can only be defined on the most upper level for the whole group. See [Battery Levels and Warnings](#battery-levels-and-warnings) for more information on the syntax. All `BatteryServices` defined in the `items` array will be ignored!
* `items`: An array of item definitions. As shown in the example, the different items will be defined here, as if they were outside of the group, either through single item definition or multiple definitions of the same type in a sub-array. Those configuration styles can be combined!

### Battery Levels and Warnings
Every accessory can be configured to show battery warnings and battery levels. The following configuration can be optionally added to every item:
```
{
    "batteryItem": "Itemname-within-OpenHAB",
    "batteryItemThreshold": "10",
    "batteryItemInverted": "false",
    "batteryItemChargingState": "Itemname-within-OpenHAB",
    "batteryItemChargingStateInverted": "false"
}
```

* `batteryItem` *(optional)*: The openHAB item representing the battery level for this accessory.
  * Needs to be of type `Switch`, `Contact` or `Number` within openHAB
  * **Note**: If the type is `Number`, then the battery warning will be based on `batteryItemThreshold` and the battery level will be the value of the item
  * **Note**: If the type is `Switch` or `Contact` the `BatteryLevel` will always show 0% and for states `ON` or `OPEN` a battery warning will be triggered
* `batteryItemInverted` *(optional)*: If `batteryItem`'s state needs to be interpreted inverted, set this value to `"true"` (Only for types `Switch` and `Contact`)
  * Default: `"false"`
  * Allowed values: `"true"` & `"false"` *don't forget the quotes*
* `batteryItemThreshold` *(optional)*: The threshold of `batteryItem`'s numeric value, below a warning will be triggered
  * Default: `"20"`
  * Allowed values: All integers
* `batteryItemChargingState`: The openHAB item representing if the device is currently charging
  * Needs to be of type `Switch` or `Contact` within openHAB
  * Default: Item will be reported as 'Not chargeable' to HomeKit if this item is not available
* `batteryItemChargingStateInverted` *(optional)*: If `batteryItemChargingState`'s state needs to be interpreted inverted, set this value to `"true"`
  * Default: `"false"`
  * Allowed values: `"true"` & `"false"` *don't forget the quotes*

### Thermostat
This service describes a thermostat.

*Important notes on Thermostat Capabilities*
* A thermostat can have the capability to cool, heat or do both
* The `modeItem` will precede `heatingItem` or `coolingItem` (when `modeItem` is defined, `heatingItem` and `coolingItem` will be ignored)
  * If `modeItem` is present while `modeItemCharacteristic` is present the allowed values for `modeItem` will be restricted based on `modeItemCharacteristic` (see below)
* If `modeItem` is not present, one of the following is required: `heatingItem` or `coolingItem`
  * Based on those, the capability to heat or cool will be derived
  * If both are present, `coolingItem` will be ignored, therefore the item will only be able to either cool or heat

The Heater/Cooler implementation within HomeKit clashes with OpenHAB. The Heater/Cooler is usable but there might be bugs around the mode. If the swing item and rotation speed item are not required, it is recommended to use the Thermostat Service!

## Additional Services & Notes from the Developer
Obviously the aim of this project is a full coverage of the HAP specification. Due to the limitations of smart devices in my home I can only test a subset and would love to have your feedback and input for this project.

Due to the very limited documentation on homebridge plugin development I have not implemented a dynamic platform (there is only [this partly complete wiki entry](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki/On-Programming-Dynamic-Platforms)). If anyone of you knows how to do it, please contact me directly!

If you have feedback or suggestions how to better represent the services as openHAB Items, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/steilerDev/homebridge-openhab2-complete/issues).

If you would like to contribute just send me a pull request. In order to add a new service you have to modify/add the following parts:
1. Create your own accessory class within `./accessory`
2. The only *required* functions are `getServices()` (returning an array of `HAP.Service` with attached `HAP.Characteristic`) and `identify()` (which does not need to do anything). Those are implemented in the `Accessory` super class and don't need to be overridden. Make sure that `this._services` is populated and reflects your service
3. Define `const type = "YourTypeName"` (this will be used inside `config.json` to identify an accessory of your type) and `function createAccessory(platform, config)` returning an instance of your Accessory.
4. Finally expose `type` and `createAccessory` through `module.exports = {type, createAccessory}`
   
My accessories are using centrally defined characteristics inside `./accessory/characteristic`. See `NumericSensor.js` for a simple characteristic implementation and `TemperatureSensor.js` for a simple accessory using this characteristic. This is not a requirement, but highly recommended. 

## Comparision
| [homebridge-openhab2 plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-openhab2) | openHAB2 - Complete Edition
--- | --- 
Verly little configuration within homebridge/openHAB, only tags within `*.items` files and inclusion within sitemap, obviously requiring both to be created manually | Explicit declaration within `config.json` not requiring instable openHAB `Metadata Provider` (removes items if state is `NULL`) and de-couples homebridge configuration from openHAB
Support only 1:1 mappings between Items and HomeKit services | Supports composite items (e.g. Thermostat, Security System, Battery States, etc.)
Uses `SSE` to receive push notifications from openHAB about state change and requires sitemap definitions | Pulling of states through REST interface & push notifications from openHAB through `SSE` *without*  the requirement of a sitemap
Thermostats never really worked | Thermostats working as expected
4 accessory types supported | 29 different accessory types supported
Light item in openHAB gets triggered multiple times from single user interaction | Light item in openHAB receives only one command per user interaction
No support for items with notification capabilities | Many HomeKit services can notify the user about a state change. Those accessories are only supported in this plugin

Concluding, I personally might only consider using the [OpenHAB homebridge plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-openhab2) in smaller, less diverse installations. However my own installation has a a lot of different device types, that I want to fully include in HomeKit, therefore this plugin is the only feasible way for me and everyone alike.
